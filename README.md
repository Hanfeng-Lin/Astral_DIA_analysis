# Analysis Code for "Ultra-High-Throughput LC-MS Method for TPD Screening"



This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used to analyze the data and generate the figures for the manuscript: **"Ultra-High-Throughput LC-MS Method for Targeted Protein Degradation Compound Screening Using the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer"**.



## About The Project



This project details the development and validation of a rapid and robust liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) workflow capable of analyzing **300 samples per day (SPD)**. The method leverages the speed and sensitivity of the **Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer** to achieve deep proteome coverage (nearly 8,000 protein groups) with high quantitative accuracy and precision (CV < 10%).



The study demonstrates the workflow's capabilities through:

- Benchmarking with standard multi-proteome mixtures to confirm quantitative accuracy across various throughputs.

  

- Assessing linearity and dynamic range using two- and three-proteome spike-in experiments.

  

- Applying the 300 SPD method to a real-world targeted protein degradation (TPD) study, profiling the dose-dependent effects of several immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) in Jurkat T cells.

  

  



## Data Availability



The raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the MassIVE database and are available via accession number **MSV000099486**.

The processed data files (output from Spectronaut) required to run the analysis scripts are in the `/data` directory.

## Getting Started



To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.



### Prerequisites

You will need to have Conda (either Anaconda or Miniconda) installed on your system to manage the environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   Bash

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hanfeng-Lin/Astral_DIA_analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**

   Bash

   ```
   cd Astral_DIA_analysis
   ```

3. **Create and activate the conda environment:** This command will create a new conda environment named `Astral` using the specifications in the `environment.yml` file and install all necessary packages.

   Bash

   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. **Activate the new environment:**

   Bash

   ```
   conda activate proteomics
   ```

5. **Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:**

   Bash

   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```

   You can now navigate to the `/notebooks` directory and run the analysis files.



## Analysis Workflow



All figures from the manuscript can be reproduced by running the Jupyter notebooks located in the `/notebooks` directory.



### 1. Three-Proteome Benchmark Analysis

- **Notebook**: `notebooks/three_proteome_analysis.ipynb`

- **Input File**: `data/20240730_165304_BCM_JW_300SPD_200ng_Report.csv` or `data/20240730_165020_BCM_JW_300SPD_50ng_Report.csv`

- **Purpose**: This notebook analyzes the benchmark experiments using the three-proteome (Human, Yeast, *E. coli*) mixtures to validate the quantitative accuracy of the method.

  

### 2. TPD Experiment Analysis (Spectronaut)

- **Notebook**: `notebooks/DataAnalysis_Spectronaut.ipynb`

- **Input File**: `data/Astral_IO8cm_TPD_580780_2Th_Report_Protein Quant (Pivot).tsv`

- **Purpose**: This script processes the Spectronaut output to analyze the dose-dependent effects of Pomalidomide, Iberdomide, and Mezigdomide on the Jurkat cell proteome.

  

### 3. TPD Experiment Analysis (DIA-NN)

- **Notebook**: `notebooks/DataAnalysis_DIANN.ipynb`
- **Input File**: Requires pg_matrix and pr_matrix report files generated by DIA-NN.
- **Purpose**: This notebook provides an alternative analysis workflow using the output from DIA-NN.
